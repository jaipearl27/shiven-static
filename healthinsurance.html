                    Health insurance is a financial product that helps individuals and families cover the rising costs
                    of medical care. It typically pays for hospitalisation, treatments, diagnostic tests, surgeries, and
                    preventive healthcare. As healthcare costs escalate annually, health insurance offers a crucial
                    safety net, ensuring that people have access to quality care without facing financial ruin. From
                    individuals to senior citizens to entire families, a reliable health insurance plan provides peace
                    of mind and financial security. With Shiven CRM, your team can efficiently manage client data,
                    compare plans, handle documentation, monitor renewals, and expand your health insurance portfolio
                    all from one powerful platform.

                        Instructing clients on fundamental policy terms increases trust and creates reasonable
                        expectations. The following are significant factors your staff needs to inform clients about:
                        <ol class="mt-2 text-gray-600"> 1. Waiting Periods: The majority of health insurance policies
                            come
                            with a waiting period before the ability to claim specific benefits. These include
                            maternity, particular illnesses, or pre-existing conditions.
                        </ol>
                        <ol class="mt-2 text-gray-600"> 2. Portability: Customers may change to another insurer without
                            losing the continuity advantages, including the waiting period credit. Shiven CRM can handle
                            portability requests and paperwork

                            client
                            has prior to taking the policy. PEDs are covered after a waiting period specified in the
                            policy.</ol>
