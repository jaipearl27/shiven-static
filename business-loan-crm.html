                    A business loan is a credit instrument that is designed to provide funding to businesses for one
                    purpose or another—whether it's starting a new business, scaling up operations, acquiring stock, or
                    for managing liquidity. Business loans also vary from personal loans because they're designed to
                    meet the particular needs of running and growing a business. Business loans may be secured and
                    unsecured, and terms of repayment typically involve fixed monthly payments, interest, and fixed
                    tenors according to lender policy.

                    For business leaders and entrepreneurs, access to the right loan is key to continued expansion and
                    addressing problems of working capital. For financial advisors who assist businesses in securing
                    loans, juggling these multiple and frequently complex loans can be more than it can handle in the
                    absence of suitable tools.
