                    A dedicated Loan Management CRM has a number of important advantages to both consultants
                    and borrowers. It streamlines the loan process to make it simple and more efficient for
                    applicants. The CRM allows automatic capture of leads from diverse digital sources and saves
                    consultants&#39; time by removing low-quality applications through automated pre-screening
                    verifications.
                    <br>
                    This not only enhances the workflow speed but also optimizes customer satisfaction and raises
                    profit margin by highlighting high-potential customers. A sound CRM system, such as Shiven
                    Infotech, assists consultants in approaching clients at the right time and assists them constantly
                    throughout the entire financial process.
