                            Variable investments are financial assets whose returns fluctuate based on market forces and
                            are not in the form of fixed or guaranteed returns. As opposed to traditional fixed
                            investments such as Fixed Deposits (FDs), variable investments carry market risk but higher
                            potential for growth. Variable investments are suitable for investors seeking long-term
                            wealth creation, portfolio diversification, and capital appreciation.
