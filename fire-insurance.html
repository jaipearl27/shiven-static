                    Fire insurance is a policy that is specialized to give financial compensation for loss or damage
                    arising from fire and allied perils. Fire insurance covers buildings, stock, machinery, furniture,
                    and other tangible assets, enabling companies, residents, and institutions to recover from untoward
                    fire incidents. Whether the loss arises due to accidental fire, lightning, explosion, or riot, fire
                    insurance serves as an important shield. For insurance consultants and advisors, providing fire
                    insurance provides high-value opportunities in commercial and residential segments. With Shiven CRM,
                    the sales of fire insurance, renewals, claims, and client interaction become effortless and
                    completely digitised.

                        Instructing clients on fundamental policy terms increases trust and creates reasonable
                        expectations. The following are significant factors your staff needs to inform clients about:
                        <ol class="mt-2 text-gray-600"> 1. Waiting Periods: The majority of Fire insurance policies
                            come
                            with a waiting period before the ability to claim specific benefits. These include
                            maternity, particular illnesses, or pre-existing conditions.
                        </ol>
                        <ol class="mt-2 text-gray-600"> 2. Portability: Customers may change to another insurer without
                            losing the continuity advantages, including the waiting period credit. Shiven CRM can handle
                            portability requests and paperwork

                        <ol class="mt-2 text-gray-600"> 3. Pre-Existing Diseases (PED): These are conditions that the
                            client
                            has prior to taking the policy. PEDs are covered after a waiting period specified in the
                            policy.</ol>
                        <ol class="mt-2 text-gray-600"> 4. Exclusions: Exclusions are conditions or treatments that are
                            not
                            covered under a policy. Some common exclusions are cosmetic surgery, self-inflicted damage,
