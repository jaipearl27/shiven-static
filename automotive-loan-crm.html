                    An automobile loan, also called a car or vehicle loan, is a secured loan offered by financial
                    institutions or banks to enable a person to buy a vehicle, new or old. The loan is generally paid in
                    equated monthly instalments (EMIs) over a duration, and the vehicle serves as security
                    untilrepayment of the loan in full. These loans are popular due to their affordability and repayment
                    choices, allowing individuals to own a car without forking out an initial lump sum of money.
