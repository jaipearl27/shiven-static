                    A home loan, commonly called a mortgage, is money lent by banks or lending institutions that enables
                    people to purchase, construct, or rebuild a house. It enables buyers of homes to acquire property
                    without having to pay the entire sum in advance. The amount borrowed is paid back over a specified
                    time with interest. Whether you are a first-time buyer or trading up to a superior dwelling, a home
                    loan is one of the most convenient and widely used ways to fund your ideal home.
