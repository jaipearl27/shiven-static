                    Personal loans are non-secured personal loans given by banks and financial institutions to
                    individuals for their own use. Personal loans are adjustable in nature and may be taken for personal
                    loans, medical expenses, marriage, holidays, education, or home improvement. As they are not
                    secured, personal loans are made available to different lenders.

                    Mostly, personal loans come with fixed interest rates and scheduled repayment periods, making it
                    easy for the borrowers to calculate monthly payments. Their quick processing and flexible
                    applications make personal loans a popular way of meeting sudden financial demands without drawing
                    on savings.
