                                Bajaj Finance, Mahindra Finance, Shriram Finance, and others are examples of NBFCs that
                                provide corporate FDs that are easy to obtain with no lengthy processes, better interest
                                rates, shorter tenures, and good renewal terms; however, they incur slightly higher risk
                                than banks.

                                Prominent jewellers like Tanishq, Malabar Gold, and Kalyan Jewellers offer RD-type
                                monthly gold saving schemes. They are similar to savings schemes, enabling customers to
                                deposit an agreed amount every month, redeemable against gold jewellery purchase at the
                                end of the period. Though not RBI-regulated, these cater to a niche group, saving for
                                jewellery purchase in the future.
