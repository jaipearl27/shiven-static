                    An education loan is a funding process that helps students and parents to fund the cost of education
                    at a university. The money usually pays for the payment of a university tuition fee, books,
                    accommodation, transport, and other miscellaneous fees. Education loans help students fund their
                    education free from the burden by offering flexible repayment terms as well as low interest rates.
                    Whether pursued in India or abroad, education loans have a significant role as a contributory factor
                    towards students ' professional and personal growth.
